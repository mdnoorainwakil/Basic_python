What is Python, and why is it popular?**\n","\n","- Python is a programming language that is easy to read and write. It was made by Guido van Rossum. It is used for many things like web development, data analysis, automation, and more.\n","- It is popular because its syntax is simple and looks like English. It has many libraries which help in doing tasks faster. Also, Python works on many platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux etc. It is used in many fields like AI, machine learning, and web apps. That is why many people like to use Python.\n","\n","**Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?**\n","\n","- An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and runs the Python code line by line. It checks each line one at a time and shows the output. If there is any error, it stops and shows the error.\n","\n","- Python uses an interpreter instead of a compiler. That is  why we don’t need to compile the whole program before running. It makes testing and debugging easy. The Python interpreter helps in running the code directly.\n","\n","**Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n","\n","- Pre-defined keywords in Python are special words that have a fixed meaning. These words are already defined by Python and we cannot use them as variable names.\n","\n","- Some examples are: if, else, for, while, True, False, def, return, etc.\n","\n","\n","**Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names? **\n","\n","No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n","\n","- If we try to use a keyword as a variable name, Python will show an error.\n","\n","- exaple :  we cannot write if = 5 or while = \"hello\" because if and while are keywords.\n","\n","\n","**Q5.What is mutability in Python? **\n","\n","- Mutability in Python means whether a value can be changed after it is created.\n","- mutability = mutable + immutable\n","\n","- If a data type is mutable, it means we can change its content without changing its identity. Example: list, dict, set are mutable types.\n","\n","- If a data type is immutable, we cannot change its content once it is created. Example: int, float, str, tuple are immutable types.\n","\n","**Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n","\n","- Lists are mutable because we can change, add, or remove items from a list after it is created. For example, we can do list[0] = 10.\n","Tuples are immutable because once we create a tuple, we cannot change its values. This makes tuples more safe and fast for fixed data.\n","\n","- The main reason is that Python made lists for dynamic data and tuples for fixed data.\n","\n","\n","**Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?**\n","\n","- The == operator checks if the values of two variables are equal.\n","The is operator checks if both variables are pointing to the same object in memory.\n","\n","a = [1, 2]\n","b = [1, 2]\n","a == b  # True\n","\n","a is b  # False\n","\n","\n","**Q8. What are logical operators in Python?**\n","\n","- Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions. Python has three main logical operators.\n","- ex - and , or , not.\n","\n","**Q9. What is type casting in Python?**\n","\n","- Type casting means changing the data type of a value from one type to another.\n","\n","**Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n","\n","- Implicit type casting is done automatically by Python when needed. Example:\n","a = 5\n","b = 2.5\n","c = a + b = 7.5\n","- Explicit type casting is done by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","x = \"100\"\n","y = int(x) = 100\n","\n","\n","**Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**\n","\n","- Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a Python program.\n","\n","- They help the program decide which block of code to run based on a condition. If the condition is true, one block runs; if false, another block runs.\n","\n","**Q12. How does the elif statement work?**\n","\n","- The elif is used to check another condition if the first if condition is false.\n","It comes after if and before else.\n","\n","x = 10\n","\n","if x > 20:\n","\n","    print(\"x is big\")\n","elif x == 10:\n","\n","    print(\"x is ten\")\n","else:\n","\n","    print(\"x is small\")\n","\n","**Q13. What is the difference between for and while loops?**\n","\n","- A for loop is used when we know how many times we want to run the loop.\n","- A while loop is used when we want to keep running until a certain condition becomes false.\n","\n","**Q14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.**\n","\n","A while loop is better when we don’t know how many times we will loop.\n","\n","password = \"\"\n","\n","while password != \"hello123\":\n","\n","    password = input(\"Enter password: \")\n","print(\"Access granted!\")\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"hUyFgsoeSyOf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Q1.Write a
